    <h1>Meditate, listen and relax  </h1>
    <p>Music has many wonderful benefits for stress management and overall health. It can help you calm your physiology without making a conscious effort, and that can alleviate stress from your mind. Music can also lift your mood, slow your breathing, and create other stress-inducing changes.</p>
    <p> Meditation is also one of the most popular stress management strategies for good reason—it brings short-term benefits like a calm mind and body, and it can build resilience toward stress over time. Combining music with meditation can deepen the positive effects of both, and bring you greater stress relief.</p>
    <h2>Time Required</h2>
    <p> While 10 minutes is a good minimum time for music medication, even one song can help reduce stress and restore energy.</p>

    <h2>Instructions for Music Mediation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><a id="quote" href="#choose"> Choose meditation music</a> that can help you relax.  This means finding music that you enjoy listening to—if you don’t enjoy classical music, for example, don’t choose it.</li>
        <li>Get into a comfortable position and relax. Many people think they need to sit with their legs crossed a certain way or use a meditation cushion, but really, whatever position you feel is comfortable is the position you should try.</li>
        <li>Stay focused on the music.  If you find yourself thinking about other things, gently redirect your attention to the present moment, the sound of the music, and the feelings in your body that the music evokes. Try to really feel the music.</li>
        <li>Continue this practice for several minutes, until your time runs out.As thoughts come into your head, gently let them go and redirect your attention to the sound of the music, the present moment, and the physical sensations you feel.</li>
    </ol>
